    <!-- Padding at the left and right edges of the incall_touch_ui button
         cluster.  This padding is necessary because we can't allow the
         buttons to be very close to the edges of the screen, due to the
         risk of false touches (from your finger wrapping around while
         holding the phone, *before* moving it up to your face and having
         the prox sensor kick in.) -->
